# Face_eye-detection
A computer vision project that detects faces and eyes in real time using OpenCV and Haar cascade classifiers.
# Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV

This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect faces and eyes in real time through a webcam. It demonstrates how Haar Cascade Classifiers can be applied in computer vision for object detection.
